We need recommender systems to generate quick recommendations for the customers within an ocean of products.
The main idea is to provide the customers with the most useful product in the least amount of time.

There are 3 types of recommender systems:
1. Content Based Systems.
Recommendations are offered based on the similarity of the content.
Eg. We usually see content based systems on Youtube where if you are watching Football content then you will see recommendation videos for Football.

2. Collaborative Filtering Systems.
Content is recommended based on user interest and similarity.
Eg. There are 2 users who are extremely similar. The similarity of the users is found to be high as they watch the same set of movies and the 
ratings given by them is also highly similar. Now, we see that user 1 is watching a new movie. As the similarity is high between the two users
we will recommend that new movie to user 2 if user 1 gives a higher rating for the movie.

3. Hybrid
In recent years, Youtube has switched to a Hybrid version. We can now see content based as well as Collaborative based systems.


In this project, we are using content based systems.
